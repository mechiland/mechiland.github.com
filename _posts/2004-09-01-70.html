<p><a href="http://www.theserverside.com/news/thread.tss?thread_id=28410">http://www.theserverside.com/news/thread.tss?thread_id=28410</a></p> <p>David的话：</p> <blockquote>It's official. Roller is now my full time job. I just accepted a job with Sun Microsystems to "design, develop, and deploy the primary blogging system for Sun in conjunction with other engineers" and to evangelize blogging both inside and outside of Sun. Needless to say, I'm thrilled. I'm honored to be working for Sun and with great folks like Will Snow, John Hoffman, Tim Bray, Patrick Chanezon, and Danese Cooper. I'm excited to be working for a company that feels the same was as I do about the value of blogs and wikis, open source software, and encouraging employees to speak with honest and authentic voice to customers, to partners, and to each other.</blockquote> <p>呵呵，看来人要出了名，生意会很多。一个开源的Roller居然引起了Sun的关注，并且聘用Dave Johnson为Sun全职开发其Roller系统。</p> <p>题外话，Roller的成功肯定不是因为其技术思想有多好，而是因为流行。换句话说，Roller满足了需求。“需求”这个东西才是产品成功的关键，其他的东西则次之。</p>
